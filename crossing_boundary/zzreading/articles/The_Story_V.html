                    <h1>The Story of an Hour</h1>
                    <p class="text">(1) Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was
                        taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.</p>
                    <p class="text">(2) It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences. Her husband's
                        friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when
                        news of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of
                        “killed”. He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram.</p>
                    <p class="text">(3) She wept at once, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself
                        she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(4) There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable armchair. Into this she sank,
                        pressed by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(5) She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees. The
                        delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The
                        notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows
                        were twittering in the eaves.</p>
                    <p class="text">(6) She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quit
                        motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(7) She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines indicated repression and even
                        a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed out there
                        on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a
                        suspension of intelligent thought.</p>
                    <p class="text">(8) There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What
                        was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and thus hard to name. But she felt it, creeping out
                        of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(9) Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this
                        thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will—as
                        powerless as her two white slender hands would have been.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(10) When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted
                        lips. She said it over and over under her breath: “free, free, free!” The vacant stare and the
                        look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses
                        beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(11) She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded
                        in
                        death; the face, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long
                        procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her
                        arms out to them in welcome.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(12) There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for
                        herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men
                        and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature.
                    <p class="text">(13) And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter!
                        What
                        could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in face of this possession of self-assertion which
                        she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(14) “Free! Body and soul free!” she kept whispering.

                    <p class="text">(15) Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole,
                        employing for admission. “Louise, open the door! I beg, open the door—you will make yourself
                        ill. What are you doing Louise? For heaven's sake open the door.”

                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(16) “Go away. I am not making myself ill.” No; She was drinking in a very elixir of
                        life through that open window.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(17) Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and
                        summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life
                        might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might belong.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(18) She arose at length and opened the door. There was a feverish triumph in her
                        eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's
                        waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them and the bottom.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(19) Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who
                        entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his bag and umbrella. He had been far from
                        the sense of accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's
                        piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text">(20) But Richards was too late.</p>
                    <p class="text">(21) When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that
                        kills.
